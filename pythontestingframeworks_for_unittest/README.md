An introduction to popular Python testing frameworks used to unit test software. Unit tests are automated tests that target and test specific areas of your code, like specific functions or methods. A unit test compares your code against the criteria defined within the test. Using unit testing while developing your code catches bugs, gaps, and regressions.

An overview of three popular Python testing frameworks; doctest, pytest, and unittest. 

    doctest: Provides an interactive command-line shell and can be integrated with tools like Jupyter Notebook with greater ease than other testing packages.Doctest is not as feature-rich as other frameworks, which limits it to simpler testing scenarios.

    pytest: Includes a simple class fixture that makes testing easier. Due to pytest’s wide adoption, there are a lot of available resources to help you learn how to use it.PyTest is feature-rich, but due to its complexity requires a strong familiarity with Python.

    unittest: Integrates easily with the Python environment and provides speedy testing. You don’t have to install anything special to use it. It’s also quite flexible and allows for detailed testing.

This framework is based on JUnit, so it doesn’t use Python’s typographical conventions. This framework also requires a lot of boilerplate code to use.
